Although previous work already partially tackled this problem, it has only considered one specific aspect: the crypto module. We instead dissect different QUIC implementations, and perform an in-depth analysis of the cost associated to many of its components. We find that the kernel to userspace communication, the crypto module and the packet reordering algorithm are CPU hungry and often the cause of application performance degradation. We use those findings to define an architecture for offloading QUIC and discuss the associated challenges.},

We have found that QUIC reduces the overall page retrieval time with respect to HTTP in case of a channel without induced random losses and outperforms SPDY in the case of a lossy channel.

abstract = {QUIC is a new transport layer protocol proposed by Google that is rapidly increasing its share from Internet traffic. It is designed to improve performance for HTTPS connections and partly replace TCP, the dominant standard of Internet for decades, in application scenarios where new requirements such as packet encryption, stream multiplexing and connection migration are emerging and which have proven to be challenging for the TCP service model. QUIC has been massively deployed to serve some of the most popular Internet services, including YouTube. To enable easy deployment and rapid evolution to the protocol, the current deployment of QUIC runs in user-space, usually as part of the Chrome/Chromium browser. This potentially reduces the achievable performance of the protocol, as each message, including control messages, triggers a context switch between kernel and user spaces. To investigate the potential performance of QUIC in kernel mode and to achieve a fair comparison between QUIC and TCP, we implement QUIC in the Linux kernel where TCP and other transport layer protocols are running. We have conducted extensive measurements in both virtual machines and in a custom-built WIFI testbed to compare the two protocols. The empirical results indicate that QUIC outperforms TCP in major application scenarios such as network with low latency and high packet loss rate, while QUIC also shows a TCP-friendly rate control when the two protocols are running concurrently.},

	abstract =	{This document defines the core of the QUIC transport protocol. QUIC provides applications with flow-controlled streams for structured communication, low-latency connection establishment, and network path migration. QUIC includes security measures that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a range of deployment circumstances. Accompanying documents describe the integration of TLS for key negotiation, loss detection, and an exemplary congestion control algorithm. DO NOT DEPLOY THIS VERSION OF QUIC DO NOT DEPLOY THIS VERSION OF QUIC UNTIL IT IS IN AN RFC. This version is still a work in progress. For trial deployments, please use earlier versions. Note to Readers Discussion of this draft takes place on the QUIC working group mailing list (quic@ietf.org (mailto:quic@ietf.org)), which is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email\_list=quic Working Group information can be found at https://github.com/quicwg; source code and issues list for this draft can be found at https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/labels/-transport.},
